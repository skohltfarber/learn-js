    <h1>Exercise 3 - Arrays</h1>
    <p>You must define an array with the following three variables:
        <ol>
            <li>A string which has the value of "What is the meaning of life?"</li>
            <li>A number which has a value of 42</li>
            <li>A boolean which has a value of true</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <h2>Array Elements</h2>
    <p>Because JavaScript Arrays are just special kinds of objects, you can have elements of different types stored together in the same array. The example below is an array with a string, a number, and an empty object.</p>
    <h3>Code:</h3>
    <pre><code>
        var myArray = ["What is the meaning of life?", 42, true];

        console.log(myArray[0]);
        console.log(myArray[1]);
        console.log(myArray[2]);</code></pre>
