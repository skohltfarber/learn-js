    <h1>Exercise 12 - Object Oriented JavaScript</h1>
    <p>
        Create a class called Person which accepts the name of a person as a string, and his/her age as a number. The Person class should have a method called describe which returns a string with the following syntax: "name, age years old". So for example, if
        John is 19 years old then the function describe of his object will return "John, 19 years old".
    </p>
    <h2>Notes:</h2>
    <p>
        Creating an object using the new keyword is the same as writing the following code:
    </p>
    <p>
        The difference between the two methods of creating objects is that the first method uses a class to define the object and then the new keyword to instantiate it, and the second method immediately creates an instance of the object.
    </p>
    <h3>Code:</h3>
    <pre><code>
        function Person(name, age) {

            this.name = name;
            this.age = age;

            this.describe = function() {
                return this.name + ", " + this.age + " years old";
            }
        }

        var jack = new Person("Jack", 25);
        var jill = new Person("Jill", 24);
        console.log(jack.describe());
        console.log(jill.describe());
    </code></pre>
