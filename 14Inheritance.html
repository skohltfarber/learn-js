    <h1>Exercise 14 - Inheritance</h1>
    <p>Create an object called Teacher derived from the Person class, and implement a method called teach which receives a string called subject, and prints out: </p>
    <pre><code>[teacher's name] is now teaching [subject]</code></pre>
    <h2>Notes:</h2>
    <p>
        JavaScript uses prototype based inheritance. Every object has a prototype, and when a method of the object is called then JavaScript tries to find the right function to execute from the prototype object.
    </p>
    <h3>Code:</h3>
    <pre><code>
        var Person = function() {};

        Person.prototype.initialize = function(name, age) {
            this.name = name;
            this.age = age;
        }

        var Teacher = function() {};
        Teacher.prototype = new Person();

        Teacher.prototype.teach = function(subject) {
            console.log(this.name + " is now teaching " + subject);
        }

        var him = new Teacher();

        him.initialize("Adam", 45);
        him.teach("Inheritance");
