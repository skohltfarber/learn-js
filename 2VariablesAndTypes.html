    <h1>Exercise 2 - Variables and Types</h1>
    <p>You must define the following variables:
        <ol>
            <li>A number called myNumber which contains the number 4;</li>
            <li>A string called myString which contains the sentence Variables are great.;</li>
            <li>A boolean called myBoolean which contains the value false;</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
        JavaScript is a "duck-typed" language, and therefore every variable is defined using the <em>var</em> keyword, and can contain all types of variables.
    </p>
    <p>Wikipedia says: Duck typing in computer programming is an application of the duck test—"If it walks like a duck and it quacks like a duck, then it must be a duck"—to determine if an object can be used for a particular purpose. With normal typing,
        suitability is determined by an object's type. In duck typing, an object's suitability is determined by the presence of certain methods and properties, rather than the type of the object itself.</p>
    <h3>Code:</h3>
    <pre><code>
        var myNumber = 4;
        var myString = "Variables are great.";
        var myBoolean = false;

        console.log("myNumber is equal to " + myNumber);
        console.log("myString is equal to " + myString);
        console.log("myBoolean is equal to " + myBoolean);</code></pre>
